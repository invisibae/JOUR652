<h2>Robert Altman is an American movie director whose list of famous movies include Nashville, The Long Goodbye, and The Player.</h2>
<p>As a member of Hollywood's "New Wave", Altman often subverted classic cinematic tropes and genre hallmarks to create interesting and challenging works of art.  While Altman's "New Wave" movies from the 70's definitely have a special place in my heart, but his longevity is another element that made him a legendary filmmaker.  </p>
<p>Altman's film's are characterized by long takes, gritty character and subject matter, and beautiful cinematography.  Altman's films also usually feature at leat a bit of timely social commentary and modern music.</p>
<p> One of my favorite songs featured in an Altman movie is "The Long Goodbye", a piece of music written by a young John Williams</p>
